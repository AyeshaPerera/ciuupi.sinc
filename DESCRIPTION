Description: 
  This package considers the event of two nested linear regression models, 
  where there is prior information suggesting that the simpler model is true. 
  It constructs a confidence interval that incorporates this uncertain prior 
  information under the assumption that the error variance is known. The package 
  uses numerical nonlinear constrained optimization to create a confidence 
  interval with the desired coverage probability and expected length properties. 
  This package is useful in situations where the error variance has been 
  accurately estimated from prior data or when the difference between the 
  dimensions of the response vector and the regression parameter vector is 
  sufficiently largeâ€”typically 30 or more. In such cases, replacing the known 
  error variance with its standard estimator results in a confidence interval 
  that, to a very good approximation, maintains the same coverage probability 
  and expected length as in the known variance case. Additionally, the package 
  can be applied when more complex models can be approximated by a linear 
  regression model with known error variance, where certain unknown parameters 
  are substituted with estimates. This confidence interval is described in 
  Mainzer, R. and Kabaila, P. 
   (2019) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2019-026>, and is a member of the family of 
  confidence intervals proposed by Kabaila, P. and Giri, K. (2009) 
  <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2009.03.018>.
